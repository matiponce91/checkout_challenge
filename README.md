# CHECKOUT CHALLENGE

## Project structure
The project is divided in two parts:
1) Client side (under `checkout_challenge/client` folder)
2) Server side (under `checkout_challenge/server` folder)

### Client
It is just a console client that calls the server side through a client (this `client` calls directly to server code 
but it is designed to allow  to implement in a future any king of transport layer)

### Server
Its structure is the following:
* actions: all the endpoints that the server allows. There is one class per actions so also could an option to have one
class with all the related endpoints (for example: having under class `Discount` all the endpoints to 
get/create/delete/update discounts instead of having 4 different classes). Actions are in charge of receiving request
data, call the appropriate service and build the response.
* services: here is where the logic is contained. Services are in charge of communicating with different layers, doing
code logic and get all the needed information.
* repository: this is the ORM layer, potentially in charge of doing database SELECTS/INSERTS/DELETES/UPDATES
* models: the database object representations.

## Run project
Once that the repository has been clone, `cd` to the base repository folder and run 
`docker build -t checkout_challenge .` on terminal. After finishing docker build, run the program doing 
`docker run -ti checkout_challenge`.

## Testing
Test would be run automatically during docker image building but also can be executed manually doing 
`docker run checkout_challenge pytest /usr/local/checkout_challenge/client` (to doing this you have to build the docker
image first)
